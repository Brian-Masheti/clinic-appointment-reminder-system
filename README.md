## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Client (React)
- **Unit tests:** React components, utility functions (`Jest`, `@testing-library/react`)
- **Integration tests:** Component/API interaction, form handling
- **E2E tests:** User flows with `Cypress` (`cypress/e2e/*.cy.js`)
- **Coverage:** Run `npx jest --coverage` in `client` for a detailed report

### Server (Express)
- **Unit tests:** Utility functions, controllers
- **Integration tests:** API endpoints with `Supertest`
- **Database isolation:** Test DB is cleared before each test
- **Coverage:** Run `npx jest --coverage` in `server` for a detailed report

---

## 🐞 Debugging Techniques

- **React error boundaries** for catching UI errors
- **Express error handling middleware** for API errors
- **Logging:** Console logs for DB connection, errors, and test setup
- **.env files:** All secrets and URIs are kept out of source code
